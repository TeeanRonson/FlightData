# PredictingFlightDelays

This project uses AirLine on time statistics and Delay Causes features

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights appears in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, published about 30 days after the month's end, as well as in summary tables posted on this website. BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released.
Runs several Machine Learning algorithms to predict delayed flights using dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics

Also includes a dataset about Pizza deliveries and predicting customer orders.
